Mathematical representation of qubits: Kets, vectors, and Bloch spheres are ways to
visualize and represent qubits.
a. We use Bloch spheres to represent qubits states visually
b. We use kets to as a shorthand representation of the math of qubits
c. We use vectors to represent all the details of the math of qubits
d. Qubits do not physically look like these representations. The physical
appearance of qubits depends on the type of qubit - a superconducting qubit
looks like a circuit, a trapped ion qubit looks like an ion.

2. The qubit counting game: The computational power of an ideal-noise-free quantum
computer scales exponentially with the number of qubits.
a. While a 55-qubit quantum computer (such as the one Google used to claim
quantum advantage in 2019) has similar processing power to a really powerful
supercomputer, IBM’s 127-qubit quantum computer and Quera’s 256 qubit
quantum computer potentially has computational power far beyond any
supercomputer.
b. However, the number of qubits is not the full story. Qubits on all current
quantum computers are noisy, meaning that they can lose the information
stored on them due to environmental noise. This is a major limitation on the
computational power of current quantum computers, and prevents them from
reaching their theoretical potential.

3. Dimensions in linear algebra: The action of a gate on a qubit is represented as a
multiplication of the gate’s matrix with the qubit state’s vector. We always write this
operation as matrix times vector, and not vector times matrix. The rule for
multiplying two objects (matrix and matrix, or matrix and vector, or vector and vector) in
linear algebra is that the number of columns in the first object must match the number of
rows in the second object. This rule holds true for matrix times vector but not for vector
times matrix.
4. Bases as rotations of the Bloch sphere: The possible outcomes of a quantum
measurement depend on the basis that the measurement is performed in. An
alternative way to visualize a change of basis is a rotation of the Bloch sphere.
a. When we measure in the Z basis, the Z axis is vertical on the Bloch sphere,
and all states are expressed as combinations of |0> and |1>, the two states
that lie along the Z axis.

b. When we measure in the X bais, the X axis is vertical on the Bloch sphere, and
all states are expressed as combinations of |+> and |->, the two states that lie
along the X axis.
c. The choice of which basis to express a state in is yours - there is nothing
inherently special about any basis.
d. In quantum computing, the conventional basis that is used is the Z basis.
5. Predicting the outcome of quantum circuits: We can combine our knowledge of the
action of gates on qubit states, and the results of measurement, to predict the outcome
of 1-qubit circuits. There are two steps to predict the outcome of such a circuit:
a. Step 1: Work out the final state of the qubit before measurement by applying
all the gates in the circuit to the qubit state sequentially
b. Step 2: Using the final state of the qubit, as well as the measurement basis,
work out the possible results of the measurement and their probabilities.
6. Quantum protocols and algorithms: Quantum algorithms and protocols are
implemented using complicated quantum circuits! Now that we know how to predict the
outcome of quantum circuits, we are ready to learn our first quantum protocol - quantum
key distribution (QKD)
