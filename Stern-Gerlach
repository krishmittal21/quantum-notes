experiment as a demonstration of the importance of measurement bases.
1. Born rule: The probability of measuring a qubit in the |0> state is given by the square
of the contribution of |0> to that qubit’s normalized state vector. Similarly, the
probability of measuring a qubit in the |1> state is given by the square of the contribution
of |1> to that qubit’s normalized state vector.
a. Physicists do not fully know why the Born rule works. However, it correctly
predicts the measurement probabilities of every quantum experiment ever done.
b. The Born rule is the main reason we normalize quantum states. The
probabilities of the state being measured as |0> or |1> must add up to 1
(since 1 implies a 100% probability, and the state will always be measured as
either |0> or |1>). Therefore, the squares of the contributions of |0> and |1> to the
quantum state must add up to 1, which is exactly what we ensure by normalizing
the state.

2. Measurement bases: So far, all of our measurements have been asking the
question - is the state of the qubit |0>, or is it |1>?  |0>
and |1> are both along the Z axis on the Bloch sphere
Therefore, these measurements are called measurements in the Z basis. A basis is
the direction along which we make our measurements.
a. We can measure in bases other than the Z basis
When we make a measurement in the X basis, the question we ask is - “Is
the state of the circuit |+> or |->”? The only possible answers we will get are
|+> or |->.

b. In general, whenever we make a measurement on a single qubit, we will get
one of two possible answers. The two possible answers are determined by
the basis we choose to measure in. In the Z basis, these two possible answers
are |0> and |1>. In the X basis, the two possible answers are |+> and |->. In other
bases, the two answers would be two other states.
c. The randomness of a quantum measurement is determined by both the
state being measured, and the basis that the measurement is performed in.
i. For example, if we measure the |+> state in the Z basis, we get |0> or |1>
randomly- half the time we get |0> and half the time we get |1>. However,
if we measure the same |+> state in the X basis, we get |+> every time
with 100% probability.
ii. Conversely, if we measure the |0> state in the Z basis, we get |0> with
100% probability (no randomness). If we measure the same state in the X
basis, we get |+> half the time and |-> half the time (randomness).
d. There is nothing special about the |0> and |1> states or the Z basis. It is just the
basis that is conventionally used for measurement, which is why we emphasized
it from the beginning. The |0> and |1> states can be expressed as
superpositions (combinations of |+> and |->) in the X basis, just as the |+>
and |-> states can be expressed as superpositions (combinations of |0> and
|1>) in the Z basis.
3. Stern Gerlach experiment: The Stern Gerlach experiment was an important historical
experiment that showed the importance of measurement bases. In this experiment, the
tiny magnetic field that electrons intrinsically possess (called spin) was measured by
looking at the interaction between the electron  and an
external magnet 

a. Stern and Gerlach expected the electrons to be deflected onto many different
positions onto a screen. However, they observed that the electrons were randomly deflected to one of two spots.
This showed that measurement on a single qubit (an electron in
this case) only produced one of two possible results.
b. When they rotated the direction of the external magnet, the two spots on
the screen also rotated by the same amount. This corresponds to changing
the basis of measurement, which changed the two possible answers they got
from the measurement.
