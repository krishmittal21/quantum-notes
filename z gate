1. The Z gate: The Z gate performs a 180 degree rotation about the Z axis, i.e., the vertical
axis. The |0> state, which already points along the Z axis, is unaffected by this gate 

The Z gate rotates the |+> state to the back of the Bloch sphere, changing it to the |->
state

The |1> state is also unaffected by the Z gate since it points in the vertical direction as
well. However, the Z gate gives the |1> state a negative sign

2. The Quantum Circuit model captures the 3 major parts of any quantum circuit: the
qubit states, gates, and measurements.
a. Measurement is the final step of any circuit. It is how we extract information
about the state of our qubits in the actual circuit. Without measurements, we
would never know what state our qubits were in and we would not get the results
of our computations.

3. When we make measurements on a circuit, we get the answer to the question: “Is the
state of the qubit |0> or |1>?” These are the only two answers we can get!
a. For some circuits, such as the one shown below, there is a definite answer to
this question. In the circuit shown below, the X gate changes the qubit from |0>
to |1>. So, when we make a measurement, we will always get |1>. We can
predict this result before we make the measurement.

b. For other circuits, such as the one shown below, there isn’t a definite answer
to this question. In the circuit below, the H gate changes the qubit from |0> to
|+>, which is a superposition of |0> and |1>. When we make a measurement on
this circuit, we will get random results - sometimes we will get |0>, and
sometimes we will get |1>. There is no way to predict before making the
measurement if we will get |0> or |1> - the results of the measurement are
truly random.

c. This is generally true for superposition states. When a qubit is in a
superposition state, the results of measurement are fundamentally random and
cannot be predicted.
d. After the measurement, the state of the qubit changes to the state that it was
measured in. Therefore, if the result of the measurement was |1>, the qubit will
be in state |1> after the measurement. Measurement can change the state of
the qubit. This change is also known as collapse.

4. We can visualize this collapse by thinking about the wave representation of qubit states.
If the qubit is in a superposition state before measurement, its wave will collapse
to the wave representing the |0> state or the |1> state after measurement.

5. If the results of measurement can be random, how do we find out what state the qubit
was in?
a. We can run the circuit and measure the state of the qubit many, many
times. Repeated measurements increase the precision of our knowledge about
the qubit. For example, if the qubit was in the |1> state at the end of the circuit,
the result of measurement will be |1> every time. If it was in the |+> state, the
results of measurement will be |0> roughly half the time, and |1> roughly half the
time.

b. Although we cannot always predict what the exact result of an individual
measurement will be, we can always predict the probability of different
possible results of a measurement. We will learn how to do this in a few
weeks!
