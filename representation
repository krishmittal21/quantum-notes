1.Ket notation: The ket notation is used to represent the state of qubits. Putting a “0” or a
“1” inside a ket shows that it represents a quantum state.

2. Bloch sphere: The Bloch sphere is a way to visually represent qubit states. It
overcomes the limitations of the arrow notation that we’ve used so far to visualize qubit
states, which is not very good for representing superposition states. Any qubit state
can be represented on the Bloch sphere.
a. The |0> state is located at the top of the Bloch sphere, and the |1> state at the
bottom.
b. Any other state on the Bloch sphere represents a superposition of |0> and
|1>. A superposition can be equal, meaning that |0> and |1> contribute equally to
the state, or unequal, meaning that either |0> contributes more or |1> does. If the
state is closer to |0>, it has a greater contribution from |0>. If it is closer to |1>, it
has a greater contribution from |1>.

3. Quantum Gates: Quantum gates manipulate or change the state of qubits. Gates are
how we create superposition, interference, and entanglement! The operation of gates
on qubits can be visualized as rotations on the Bloch sphere.
a. To visualize these rotations, we need to associate a coordinate system with the
Bloch sphere. 

4. The X gate: The X gate can be visualized as a 180 degree rotation about the X axis.
5. The H gate: The H gate creates superposition. It is a uniquely quantum gate!
Here, |+> and |-> represent two superposition states.
