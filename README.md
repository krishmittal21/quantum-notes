Quantum Notes
This repository contains a collection of notes on quantum computing. The notes are written in a way that is accessible to beginners, but they also contain more advanced material for those who are interested.

The notes are organized into the following sections:

Introduction to Quantum Computing
Quantum Mechanics
Quantum Computation
Quantum Information
Quantum Applications
Each section contains a number of notebooks that cover the relevant topics in detail. The notebooks are written using Jupyter Notebooks, which are a popular tool for interactive data science and machine learning.

The notebooks are accompanied by a number of resources, including:

A glossary of terms
A list of references
A link to a forum where users can ask questions and discuss the notes
I hope you find these notes helpful!
